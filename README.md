# Node.js REST API Example

This example shows how to implement a simple REST API using Node.js and Docker. The API has five endpoints that all return a simple response in JSON.

* GET /
* GET /:id
* POST /
* PUT /
* DELETE /

## Build

```
docker build -t nodejs-rest-api-example .
```

## Run

Run in default port `4000`:
```
docker run -p 4000:4000 -d nodejs-rest-api-example
```

Run in custom port, e.g., `8080`:
```
docker run -e PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 -d nodejs-rest-api-example
```

## Test
